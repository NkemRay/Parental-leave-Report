From the analysis Healthcare and Transportation sector have the highest number of both paid paternity and maternity leave and it is expected because these sectors are heavily regulated and may receive public funding.

Hospitality been the sector with the least number of paid weeks could be due to low profit margin, lack of governmental regulations and part-time work method that is characterized by this sector.
